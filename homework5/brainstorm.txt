1. search for dark matter, smallsats/cubesats, black holes, search for 
exoplanets, relativistic GPS
2. relativistic GPS:

The GPS cannot function without taking into account Einstein's theory of
relativity. As both the satellite and the receiver are at different
 gravitational potentials, their clocks are not synchronized until the 
relativistic effects are taken into account. 
 exoplanets: NASA Exoplanet archive
This dataset will help me analyze trends of the confirmed exoplanets. The
dataset has information on the number of stars, number of planets, temperature,
radius, etc.
black holes: file:///Users/april/Downloads/s42254-021-00364-9.pdf
Massive black holes(MBH) formation process, seed masses, time of formation, 
environment
3. For relativistic effects of GPS, I could simulate how much GPS satellite
clocks would drift without relativity. I would use loops and conditionals and
use functions that include special relativity and general relativity formula.
I would plot everything out using matplotlib at the end. 
4. 
a) Interactive program that simulates how time dilation affects GPS satellites
orbiting Earth, comparing LEO, MEO, GEO
b) Program that calculates how much GPS satellite clocks differ from clocks
on Earth, and the effects of general+special relativity
