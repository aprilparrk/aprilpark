# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# Git tracks changes in your code, GitHub is where you can store Git repositories and collaborate with other coders, and Git Bash lets you use Git commands in a Unix-style command line
# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
#Terminal is the program where you can interact with your computer using test, and command line is the interface inside the terminal where you type 
# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# Powershell is the default command-line shell, while Git Bash is a Unix-style shell.
# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
#Python is a coding language, and conda is a package that installs Python. Anaconda is the distribution that comes with Python, conda, and other libraries
# 5) What is VS Code? 
#VS Code a platform where you can edit your code
# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
#Jupyter Notebook is where you can write Python codes and run them, and Jupyter Lab is an interface that includes notebooks and other explorers. 
# 7) What does ~/ mean?
#Home directory
# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
#Absolute path shows full path to file from the root, while relative path starts from the current directory. 
# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
#Absolute: /Users/april/python_decal_fa2025/course_assignments/homework2
#Relative: python_decal_fa2025/course_assignments/homework2
# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
#cd ..
# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# It would remove the current directory
# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add: It saves the changes
# git commit: Saves in repository
# git push: Uploads your commits to GitHub
# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
#Git add . stages all changes in the current folder, and git add<files> stages just that file
# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
#git status shows which files are being tracked, and git log -1 shows the most recent change
# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
#Cloning is copying the whole repository, and pulling from it is to update your existing repository with the changes from GitHub
# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#I haven't had any major bugs in coding so far, but I still struggle with using GitHuband and the terminal window as they are new to me. I plan to practice more with it in the future.
# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
#I'm still confused about using and memorizing the commands on terminal.
# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
#I play the flute and guitar!
# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(12 % 5) #I think modulus operator is cool because it prints the remainder of a division operation
